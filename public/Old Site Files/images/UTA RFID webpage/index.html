        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <div>
          <p><strong>Dr Erick C Jones: </strong><br />
            Dr. Erick C. Jones, in an effort to support the marriage of industries'   supply chain needs for automatic identification technology with   academia's theoretical applications, has created an industry / academia   collaboration. This facility's purpose is to support project initiatives   like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Logistics (Supply Chain   Engineering), Manufacturing (Six-Sigma and Lean initiatives), and   Information Technology (ERP, WMS). The facility's goal is to enhance the   Industrial Engineering field by utilizing some of research   methodologies to provide solutions in the areas of RFID, Supply Chain   Logistics, and Engineering Management.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <div>
          <p> The Lab's current focus is on RFID related research projects. Other projects that the center is currently addressing are:</p>
          <p> - Supply Chain Logistics/Supply Chain (warehouse location) Analysis for a city governmen.</p>
          <p>- Engineering Management-Productivity tool that measures the productivity   of engineers and knowledge workers from behavioral characteristics.</p>
          <p>- RFID in the Mechanical Contracting Industry-Asset tracking development   funded by the Mechanical Contracting Educational Research Fund (MCERF).</p>

      <p>…scholarly and thought provoking…The book is described as 'a handbook of in-depth case studies' and in this it undersells itself…over 600 pages of delight…a nice mixture of mathematical rigour and scientific analoques and intuition…the mathematical techniques are treated with just the right level of common-sense rigour that I associate with the best applied mathematics teachers…the treatments of some of more awkward topics such as bifurcations in ODEs and Greens functions, are some of the simplest and most transparent I have seen…hundreds of worked examples and exercises. The Special Topics chapter is superb…There are countless references, and the book is literally a gold-mine.</p>

      <p>Clampitt's RFID Certification Textbook is by far the most complete RFID guide I 've seen, covering not only systems and components but technology and theory, with simple explanations that drill down into deep technical know-how. Don' t plan an RFID project without it. </p>
