							    30. (PI) National Science Foundation - RET Supplement, I/UCRC CELDi, 07/14/2006- 07/13/2007. This application by Dr. Erick Jones requests Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) supplement funding for “NSF I/URC CELDi at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln” (NSF Award #0540211). At UNL’s CELDI Center, there are two research opportunities that would positively engage K-12 science educators</h5>

                              31. (PI) National Science Foundation - REU Supplement, I/UCRC CELDi, 02/28/2006-02/27/2007. This proposal seeks support for undergraduates to participate in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates program (NSF03-577). Two research opportunities have been identified that would positively engage potential REU candidates. The scope of the project focuses on the validation of RFID technologies that will operate in the International Space Station (ISS). The RFID technologies have been described to have the ability to track inventory more efficiently than other current technologies. The recent news coverage that demonstrated the ISS lack of knowledge about consumable products has created a need to better track inventory at the ISS. This research seeks to investigate this emerging technology of RFID as a plausible solution.</h5>

                                32. (PI) National Science Foundation (NSF), Industry /University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) as part of the Centers of Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi), at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 08/31/2005 - 08/30/2007. This research is innovative from the perspective that relatively few investigators have pursued studies designed specifically for current realities in logistics. The intellectual merits of this research are the development of new inventory control models, transportation network design strategies and models, and facility location methodologies relevant for next generation logistical systems. The broader impacts are after a successful compilation of these studies we will provide new tools with which companies and researchers can have more success in integrating RFID technology into distribution and logistics. Further, these models will enable smaller companies with limited resources to explore benefits of new technology for their logistical operations. Further, the strength of having three representative CELDI Universities focused on expanding the research applications with this enabling technology, and providing examples of how to implement in real-world applications is a powerful way of supporting the NSF I/URC vision. The vision is fulfilled with Universities providing support to industry in defining research that can be applied to projects that assist companies in improving and becoming more profitable and efficient.</h5>

The objective of this engagement is to benchmark, evaluate, and document recommendations for an effective approach purchasing and implementing an Integrated Health Care System. The Integrated Health Care System (IHCS) evaluation will asses current information technology (IT) systems and recommend where new technologies can improve and enhance current operations.</h5>

This project investigates the use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies as a Real-Time Location System (RTLS) in order to minimize the amount of astronaut time that is spent taking inventory and managing stowage logistics onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The proposed RFID based RTLS system will be integrated and possibly enhance with the existing Inventory Management System (IMS) tools used by NASA to keep track of inventory in space.</h5>
