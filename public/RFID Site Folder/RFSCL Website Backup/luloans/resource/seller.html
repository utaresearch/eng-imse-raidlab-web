                                <strong>Do your   homework</strong>.<br />
                          Read a couple of books on home selling, go through the   real estate section of the local newspaper and attend some Open Houses in the   your area.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Hire a specialist</strong>.<br />
                          As a   neighborhood realtor that specializes in listing in your area, I know what it   takes to sell in this market. I welcome your call!<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Set   the price</strong>.<br />
                          Ask your realtor for an analysis of the local market   and an opinion of the best price range for your home.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Set a marketing strategy.</strong><br />
                          Have your realtor discuss a   marketing plan and include the main elements in the listing   presentation.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Get the house ready.</strong><br />
                          With   your realtor, take a hard, objective look at your home. Prioritize what needs to   be done, and decide how much you can spend in time and money to make it look its   best before opening it up to buyers. Get rid of all clutter and put some of your   stuff in storage to make the rooms and closets roomier. Put together an   information packet on local amenities, your utility bills and other helpful   information.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Keep on top of the   process.</strong><br />
                          Stash some quick clean-up supplies close at hand, and do   a fast run-through before letting a prospective buyer preview your home. <br />

                            <em>What are the six biggest mistakes home   sellers make?</em> </strong></a><br />
                          <br />
                          Sadly, many sellers just don't   do their homework. If you're like most people, your home is your most valuable   investment. When you sell it, you'll want to pocket the biggest possible net   gain or profit. But, when you sell your home, you need to understand the   competition. There are other home sellers in your area, and just like in any   other competition, mistakes can be costly. Here are some common home seller   slip-ups we can help you avoid:<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Overpricing or   under-pricing.<br />
                          </strong>By setting the price too high, you turn away the   best prospects for your home. By asking too little, you'll probably sell faster   but net less from the sale. We can do a comparative market analysis and help you   set the best price for your home.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Selling &quot;As   Is.&quot;<br />
                          </strong>In the competitive home sale marketplace, you need to show   your house at its best. Your home should be in &quot;move-in&quot; condition from the   first day it's listed. We can point out your home's chief assets and suggest how   to highlight them, as well as help you identify which items need   improving.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Over-improving.<br />
                          </strong>While   clearing out clutter, cleaning and repairs are important ways to get your home   ready for sale, undertaking a major project could cost more money than you would   recover from the sale. However, some major repairs, like replacing a roof,   should be done if they are needed.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Selling it   yourself.<br />
                          </strong>Although doing your own marketing looks tempting as a   way to save money, surveys show self-sellers often net less from the sale than   sellers who use a real estate agent. And self-sellers find that agents do a lot   more than most people think - from bringing qualified buyers to keeping things   on track to settlement.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Failing to offer financial   incentives.<br />
                          </strong>Special options can attract buyers without costing a   lot. Often, incentives like a home warranty or paying points or some closing   costs can be figured in when setting the price of the home.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Ignoring your agent's advice.<br />
                          </strong>As experienced   professionals, we know what works and what doesn't. Let's discuss any advice you   are uncomfortable with or disagree with, and together find the best way to sell   your home.<br />

                            <em>What do I have to lose if I   sell my home myself?</em></strong> </a><br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Time<br />
                          </strong>To get your home sold, you would have to   advertise and then baby sit the phone, waiting for responses to your ad. We have   an office staff to handle this and to sort out serious callers from others. We   can also pre-qualify prospective buyers and make arrangements to show the   house.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Money<br />
                          </strong>You're likely to attract   bargain-hunting buyers who seek out for-sale-by-owner homes, expecting to get a   lower purchase price because of the saved sales commission. We will advise you   how to price the house to sell fast for the best price.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Access<br />
                          </strong>Self-selling limits exposure to prospects who   see the yard sign, if one is used, or newspaper ads. We bring with us a network   of contacts and a computerized listing service that puts every agent in town to   work selling your house.<br />
                          <br />
                          <strong>Peace of   mind<br />
                          </strong>When selling by owner, the homeowner is responsible for   negotiating a legal contract and seeing that every detail of the contract is   carried out. We can screen out unqualified prospects, help arrange financing,   and shepherd the sale to settlement.<br />
                          <br />

                          <em>What is the benifit   to offering a home warranty?</em></strong></a><br />
                          <br />
                          You need more than   clever gimmicks to sell a home these days so, many savvy home sellers offer home   warranties. Buyers love them because warranties pay for certain home repairs for   a year after the sale. Many sellers love them, too, for several   reasons:<br />
                          <br />
                          1) Warranties help get the home sold<br />
                          <br />
                          2) Sellers are also   covered for many of the items up until closing at no additional cost.<br />
                          <br />
                          3)   Peace of mind.<br />
                          <br />
                          Typically, home warranties cover the repair or replacement   of a home's heating, plumbing, and electrical systems and major built-in   appliances. The cost often runs $395-$550, typically with a small deductible for   each repair or replacement. </span><span class="style4"><br />
