                                </a><em>Qualifying For a Home   Loan<br />
                                </em></strong><br />
                            The first step is to figure out the amount that you are   qualified to borrow, and determine the options available to you. This will   increase your borrowing power. There are many Lenders that have programs that   allow first time homebuyers to put little or no money down depending on your   credit history and loan amount.<br />
                            <br />
                            Complete the online form and we find the   Lenders that will pre approve you based on the information you provide. If you   have not begun to look for a home, you can estimate the property value. This   will at least give you a starting point.<br />
                            <br />
                            Once you complete the online   form, the lenders that fit your criteria will contact you to make their best   loan offers. They will also discuss the lending options that are available to   you.</p>
                              <p class="bodyText"><strong>You should consider:</strong><br />
                                <em>The down payment</em><br />
                              This is   the amount of money you have available to put a down payment on the house you   want to purchase. Depending on your credit history, you may qualify for a loan   program that requires 0% down.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText"><em>Don't forget to budget for closing   costs</em><br />
                            There are other costs beside your down payment associated with   purchasing a home. First time homebuyers have to take into consideration closing   costs. Some additional fees associated with closing costs are points, lender's   fees, title charges, escrows for your property taxes and home owners insurance.   Many loan programs allow the seller to contribute up to 6% of the sales price to   your closing costs.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText"><em>What monthly payment is comfortable for   you</em><br />
                            Just because you qualify for a certain loan amount doesn't mean you   are required to use the maximum financing available to you. Along with the   mortgage payment, property taxes, homeowner insurance and all of your monthly   liabilities don't forget to budget for thing you like to do. Vacations,   entertainment, future college tuition etc. also cost money and you do not want   to deprive yourself. You do not want overextend your budget and work solely to   make your mortgage payment.<br />
                            <br />

                            <p class="bodyText"><strong><em>Choosing your loan program</em><br />
                            </strong><br />
                            Once your loan   application is pre-approved, our Lenders will review the loan options that are   available to you. They will help you determine what type of loan is best-suited   to your financial and personal situation.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText">Once you choose your loan   program, your Lender will issue you a pre-approval letter. Your Pre-approval   Letter will include your maximum financing, your loan program details and your   monthly payment. You can use this letter to go shopping for your new   home.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText"><strong>You should consider:</strong><br />
                              <em>Your financial   situation</em><br />
                            How much money do you have for a down payment and closing   costs? Will this totally empty your bank account? You may want to consider a   loan program that allows you to put less money down so that you have some money   in reserves.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText"><em>The length of time you plan on staying in the   home</em><br />
                            Most first time homebuyers sell their homes within the first five   years of purchase. You may not want to spend a lot of money on points to get a   lower rate on your mortgage because you will not be in the house long enough to   recoup your savings. Also, you may want to consider an arm that has a lower   monthly payment. If you plan to sell your home within two years you may want to   consider an FHA one year arm. If the rate for the first year is 5% the maximum   your loan can increase is 1% in the next year. So the second year interest rate   cannot exceed 6%.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText"><em>Your personal credit history</em><br />
                            If you have less   than perfect credit, there are loan programs that will allow you to work on   improving your credit and reward you for doing so. For example, our Lenders have   several rewards programs that allow you to enjoy a reduction in your interest   rate without refinancing. If you make 24 months mortgage payments on time, your   rate will automatically reduce. They also have adjustable rate mortgages that   will allow you to convert to a 30 year fixed at each adjustment period. Ask your   Lender for details of special financing programs.<br />

                            <p class="bodyText">Once you have been Pre-qualified, choose your loan   program and have been issued a Pre-approval certificate, it's time to go house   shopping. It is recommended that you seek the services of a professional real   estate agent.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText">Once you have found the home that meets all of your needs,   you will negotiate a sales price and then sign a sales agreement. Many   homebuyers have an attorney review this contract to make sure everything is in   order.<br />
                            <br />
                                <strong>You should consider:</strong></p>
                            <p class="bodyText"><em>Your real estate agent</em><br />
                            Be   sure to use a real estate agent that works for you. Your real estate agent   should be knowledgeable and familiar with the area that you want to purchase   your new home. The best way to find a good real estate agent is to ask for   referrals. Pick an agent that wants to work with you in fulfilling your home   purchase needs.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText">The length of time you will remain in the home<br />
                            If you   plan on never moving again, will this home meet your needs? Do you plan on   moving in a few years? Are you planning a family or will your income increase   over several years? It is important to know how long you plan on staying in your   home before you purchase.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText"><em>The neighborhood</em><br />
                            Don't make the   mistake of purchasing a home in a neighborhood you know nothing about. Will this   neighborhood meet your needs? Ask the neighbors the true story about the   neighborhood.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText"><em>Type of Property</em><br />
                            Are you looking for a single   family home, a townhouse, or condo? Before you begin your house shopping, decide   what type of property that will satisfy your needs. Also don't purchase a house   that may be hard to resell. When you are looking for a home, think about how you   would sell it!<br />

                            <p class="bodyText">Now that you have found your property and   have a signed sales agreement, it is time to process your loan application with   your Lender for final approval. This step gathers and verifies all the   documentation for your loan. A real estate appraisal will be preformed to   determine the value and condition of the property you are purchasing. Your title   work, a survey, a house inspection (not the same as an appraisal) and a termite   inspection may also be ordered.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText">Once your file is complete, it is sent to   underwriting to validate the documentation provided by you. The underwriter may   request addition documentation at that time. Most Lenders' use automated   underwriting systems. This allows the lender to speed up the lending   process.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText">Once your information is validated, you will be issued a final   loan commitment. Then you can schedule your settlement.</p>

                              <em>Providing Documentation</em><br />
                            Be sure to give yourself   plenty of time to process your loan. Time is of the essence. When documentation   is requested, it is in your best interest to forward the information to your   Lender as soon as possible. Often times, your file can not be moved to the next   processing step without the necessary documentation. Providing documentation on   a timely basis will make your loan application process much   smother.</p>

                            We realize that the lending process can be very   stressful. There is a lot of work to be done. That is why our Lenders have an   informed staff that will help you through every step of the way. If you need   assistance with any matter, make sure to contact your Lender   directly.<br />

                            <p class="bodyText">This is the final step in purchasing your new home.   This step is the actual closing of the real estate transaction between you and   the seller of the property. Generally, the settlement takes place at the title   company. All of the interested parties meet to sign the final documentation. You   may be in the room with the seller, the seller's real estate agent, your real   estate agent, your attorney and if the seller brings an attorney. This final   step will need to be coordinated with all partied involved.</p>
                            <p class="bodyText">Once all of   the settlement papers are signed and monies are exchanged, you receive the keys   to your new home, along with copies of all the closing documents.   Congratulation- You are now a proud new homeowner!</p>

                            Request a copy of   the HUD settlement statement prior to your closing. This form summarizes the   entire financial transaction. It will also let you know the amount you will need   at the settlement table. In most cases you are required to bring certified funds   to the settlement. You do not want to be short money at the settlement   table.</p>
