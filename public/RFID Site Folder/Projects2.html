							  <h5><strong>University of Nebraska-Lincoln</strong></h5>
								<h5><br>
							  7. (PI) Aurora Cooperative Corporation, “Evaluating Transportation to Reduce Ethanol Production Cost” ” (Co-PI , Demet Batur) To provide Aurora Cooperative (ACO) team a facility capacity analysis that determines the best methods for maximizing the future processing capacity of inbound grain volume at the Aurora West Grain Terminal. The long-term goal of the research is to provide a service that allows Sponsor(s) to run different scenarios that may lead them to solution that optimizes the plant output.</h5>
								<h5><br>
								8. (PI) Mid America Transportation Center, “MATC Educational Project: MATC Scholars ProgramTo fulfill the need of transitioning minority students to successful performance at<br>
							  research extensive institutions and graduate school. The project entails working with faculty and providing seminars that identify common challenges for minority students from minority serving institutions and or smaller teaching focused universities and tracking their progress and feedback.</h5>
								<h5><br>
							  9. (Co-PI) NASA EPSCOR, “NASA Astronaut Hand Evaluations for Gloves in Space” (PI, Ram Bishu), 10/1/2009-06/30/2010, Analyze NASA data base on hand anthropometry and to develop principal component analyses based hand sizes. To develop measures to define glove sizes, develop evaluation protocol and performance model.</h5>
								<h5><br>
							  10. (PI) NASA EPSCOR, “RFID and RTLS Enhancement for Inventory Management and Logistics Space Transportation Systems” Research, design, and develop technologies that support our research concept of “crew-free” inventories. Moreover, this research may provide a means for consumable inventory, experiments, and other important assets to be “located” or found using a simple to operate device.</h5>
								<h5><br>
							  11. (PI) Alfred P. Sloan Foundation “Increasing PhDs for Underrepresented Minorities Program, University of Nebraska Program”, awarded 9/23/2007, (1 student awarded: Angela Garza -Industrial Engineering), Student expected graduation 5/15/2014There is currently no accurate information on the retention statistics of underrepresented minorities at the University of Nebraska. This proposal request that the Sloan Foundation use the retention statistics across all of the other Sloan underrepresented programs of 80%.</h5>
								<h5><br>
							  12. (Co-PI) “Investigation and Evaluation of Windmill Safety Using the Analytical Hierarchy Process”, Nebraska Center for Energy Sciences Research, NCESR, Energy Research Grants (PI, Michael W Riley) Submitted 07/15/2009 This research investigates best safety practices that support effective operating procedures in windmill powered energy environments. Best practices will be investigated through extensive interviews from industry experts, visits to local windmill facilities, and literature review. This research seeks to further develop a decision modeling tool for selecting the most effective safety practices for windmill power operations.</h5>
								<h5><br>
							  13. (PI) Mid-American Transportation Center (MATC), “Evaluation of RFID Technologies for Linear Roadside Assets”, (Co-PI, Judy Perkins), Prairie View A&amp;M University, Prairie View, TX, (required matched funds, award value) Explore and evaluate linear asset tracking methods. The project will utilize information from the Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) and the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) as well as a literary search to determine critical needs and several methods of tracking linear assets. Methods will be evaluated to determine ability to meet project-critical needs.</h5>
								<h5><br>
								14. (PI) NASA EPSCOR, RFID and RTLS Enhancement for Inventory Management and Logistics Space Transportation Systems (Match required) Investigate use of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies as a Real-Time Location System (RTLS) in order to minimize the amount of astronaut time that is spent taking inventory and managing stowage logistics onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The proposed RFID based RTLS system will be integrated and possibly enhance with the existing Inventory Management System (IMS) tools used by NASA to keep track of inventory in space.<br>
								<br>
							  15. (PI) Aurora Cooperative Corporation, “Evaluating Grain Supply Chain Logistics Costs for Aurora Tri Terminal Expansion” (Co-PI’s , Mike Riley, Jeffrey Woldstad), 03/03/2009-05/01/2010. To provide the Aurora Cooperative (ACO) team a network flow cost analysis, which includes an energy consumption savings component for use in a Nebraska Department of Energy proposal. The main intent is to describe the results that best demonstrate the economic and energy benefits of expanding Aurora’s network capacity through facility expansion and consolidation of freight with respect to their distribution network.</h5>
								<h5><br>
							  16. (Co-PI) Nebraska Department of Economic Development, Tenneco Plant Supply Chain Modeling (PI, Jeonghan Ko). Provide the DED team an initial facility location comparison based upon data provided by the “Tenneco” Cozad Pant (TCP). The main intent is to describe the results that best demonstrate the benefits of the TCP with respect to other plants in the Tenneco’s supply chain network. The long term goal is to provide a service that allows Client(s) to run different scenarios that may lead them to work on solutions that may further encourage organizations to locate and retain their operations to the State of Nebraska.</h5>
								<h5><br>
							  17. (PI) NASA EPSCOR, “RFID and RTLS Enhancement for Inventory Management and Logistics Space Transportation Systems” (required matched funds). 01/01/2009- 12/31/2009The objective of this project is to measure and evaluate the performance of the latest Gen 2 passive technologies. Specific goals include evaluating the performance of off the roll COTS RFID Gen 2 tags; Evaluate the performance of RFID Gen 2 labeled NASA consumable items and supplies; and describe the possible uses of Gen 2 passive tags for NASA and suggest alternative RFID technologies that need to be investigated.</h5>
