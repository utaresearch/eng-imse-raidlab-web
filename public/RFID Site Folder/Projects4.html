                                21. (PI) NASA EPSCOR Undergraduate Microgravity Research Program Travel Grant, “Testing of RFID Technologies. The long term research objective is to design a reliable RFID system at the can be manufactured at the micro scale level. The research objective of this proposal is to test and evaluate the manufacturing design of antennas for RFID tags at the micro scale level. These effects can be evaluated after testing of antennas designed from micro manufactured process such as EDM.</h5>
                              <h5><br>
                                22. (PI) Mid-American Transportation Center (MATC), “Evaluation of RFID Technologies for Roadside Safety”, (Co-PI, Judy Perkins), Prairie View A&amp;M University, Prairie View, TX, 06/01/2008 - 06/01/2009. To perform a stakeholder analysis for utilizing radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies to assist with PRISM objectives at roadside. This ten month project unites researchers and students from University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Prairie View A&amp;M University in applied research that supports a system approach for quantifying the data collection infrastructure and operating risks that can be utilized by several transportation agencies. The project will utilize information from the Nebraska Department of Motor Vehicles (NEDMV), the Nebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) and the Nebraska State Patrol (NSP) to perform stakeholder analysis, an evaluation of RFID technologies in comparison to Automatic License Plate Systems (ALPR), and determine the return on investment.</h5>

                                23. (PI) NASA and VerdaSee Solutions, “Testing of RFID Gen 2 Technologies for NASA ISS”, 10/01/2007 - 04/01/2008. Help the NASA Constellation Program Crew Expedition Vehicle (CEV) Program Office to identify a better mechanism to track consumables and other critical hardware without impacting crew time.</h5>
                              <h5><br>
						      24. (PI) Alfred P. Sloan Foundation - Increasing PhDs for Underrepresented Minorities Program, University of Nebraska Program, awarded 9/23/2007, (1 student awarded: Catherine Atwood-Architectural Engineering), Student expected graduation 5/15/2012. The objective of this proposal is to receive approval for faculty participation by Dr. Erick C. Jones, a former Sloan Fellow 2002 and a new tenure track faculty at the University of Nebraska, in this program.</h5>
								<h5><br>
							    25. (PI) NASA EPSCOR, Travel Grant, 05/01/2007 - 05/01/2008. Help the NASA Constellation Program Crew Expedition Vehicle (CEV) Program Office to identify a better mechanism to track consumables and other critical hardware without impacting crew time.</h5>
								<h5><br>
							    26. (PI) City of Houston Health and Human Services Department, “Information Technology System Innovation Analysis”, 04/22/2007 -04/21/2008. The objective of this engagement is to benchmark, evaluate, and document recommendations for an effective approach purchasing and implementing an Integrated Health Care System. The Integrated Health Care System (IHCS) evaluation will assess current information technology (IT) systems and recommend where new technologies can improve and enhance current operations.</h5>

								  27. (Co-PI) Mechanical Contractor Education Research Foundation (MCERF), “Evaluation of RFID in Construction Industry”, Tim Wentz (Co-PI), Terry Stentz (Co-PI), 03/01/2007 through 03/09/2008. Provide a representative demonstration and evaluation of how RFID technology can be used by mechanical contractors on construction projects to more effectively control property and material losses and to prevent the pilferage of tools and equipment.<br>
								  <br>
							    28. (PI) National Science Foundation – INTL Supplement, I/UCRC CELDi, 08/24/2006 through 08/23/2007. This proposal presents a plan to broaden the research and industry base of the Center for Engineering Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) NSF I/URC program based at the University of Arkansas. The CELDi program contains six academic partners (University of Arkansas, the University of Louisville, Oklahoma State University, the University of Oklahoma, Lehigh University, and the University of Florida) focusing their collective research efforts on inventing, developing, and expanding the research knowledge of logistics and distribution engineering. We propose expanding this multi-university center to include researchers from the University of Nebraska. This new academic center member will broaden CELDi’s research scope by considering research problems and issues affected by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies, specialized facility location strategies, and logistics networks of non-traditional distribution operations. This new center will create a broader industry sector representation at CELDi, by bringing a leading city government, and an exploratory research management firm (industry sectors not well represented by the center’s member base), as well as additional member from other non-traditional distribution firms.</h5>
