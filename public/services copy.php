              <h2>RFID and Automation Readiness Audit</h2>
              <p>RAID LABS has worked with several organizations to identify their return on investment for using automation such as RFID and barcodes.Our team of RAID LABS trained students are trained to optimize this process and schedule. This audit generally takes approximately  1 and a half days to review critical operations that RFID support. In advanced manufacturing operations there may be additional time needed to review KANBAN, Material Handling Systems, and WMS and other techniques that automation supports.</p>

              <h2>Automated Logistics Operational Audit</h2>
              <p>This audit is an extensive review of operations and how automation such as RFID will help or not help an organization improve their bottom line. Our team of RAID LABS trained students are industrial engineers who focus on the complexities of inventory control, automation, and efficiencies. Often time study is warranted for these more robust studies. These projects could range from 3 days to 12 weeks depending on the complexity and expected Engineering Economic evaluation complexities.</p>

              <p>These training sessions take place in our RFID and Auto ID labs, and highlight the systems used in our research. This is geared toward those interested in more information about the systems used and what potential purpose they may hold in industry specific applications.</p>

              <h2>Lean Six Sigma Executive Investment Questionnaire</h2>
              <p>This ISCEA backed study is focused upon the concept that Lean Six Sigma should have a more critical eye from investors and key company executives. This study focuses on metrics that support the concept that executives should know when to start, stop or re-invest into a company-wide Lean Six Sigma initiative. The results of the study will be presented in an annual study and report for those executives involved.</p>

              <h2>Item Level Inventory Tracking</h2>
              <p>Tracking assets on the item level is beneficial across a broad cross-section of industries, but the retail sector has one of the highest ceilings in terms of opportunity from the use of RFID. Tracking items through the supply chain is wonderful, but now think about tracking items through the supply chain all the way to the point of sale.</p>

              <h2>RTLS (Real Time Location System)</h2>
              <p>The Ubisense RFID system at RAID labs has the capability to track the real time location of assets and employees. Whether one has to measure the efficiency of an employee, the effectiveness of a floor plan or track the movement of an asset, the RTLS system provides visibility in any number of locations.</p>

              <h2>Library Systems</h2>
              <p>An RFID library solution improves the efficiency of circulation operations. While barcodes require line of sight, RFID tags can be read from multiple angles which means the checkout and check-in process is significantly faster. Also, taking inventory of books on the shelf is dramatically faster. </p>

              <h2>Asset Tracking</h2>
              <p>RFID can be used to track assets of almost all kinds. IT assets such as server blades, laptops, tablets, and other peripherals are costly investments for any company, not to mention that information stored on those items could prove detrimental in the wrong hands. RFID tags give the IT team the ability to quickly do an inventory count and make sure everything is in place. RFID can also be used in tool tracking in which the system provides information about which employees are using the tools and which tools haven’t been returned to the inventory.</p>

              <p>Certain areas require an expected level of security and access. From doors to parking lots, RFID access control tags restrict access to only those pre-approved. </p>

              <p>This particular application of RFID proves to be useful in large events such as conferences, concerts and at various public gatherings. Attendees can be tracked and the traffic can be streamlined using proper RFID systems. With an RFID attendee solution, the registration lines or check-in counters can be eliminated.</p>
