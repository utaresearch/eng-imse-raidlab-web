                            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be particularly deadly in the nation's densely populated cities. This early-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will investigate methods 
                                that integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI), data science, and automatic data capture technologies to design supply mechanisms that effectively deliver therapeutic medicines to underserved 
                                urban communities that are particularly vulnerable to this disease. Hospitals are expected to operate at capacity treating only the most severe cases, these new supply chains will focus on 
                                the home as point-of-care. Does the project represent a collaboration between the PI and the City of Houston Department of Health and Human Services (HDHHS) which currently supports the city's 
                                hospital districts, the veterans? Administration, and neighborhood healthcare centers. The supply chain models investigated in this project are expected to have wide applicability to similar large 
                                urban environments across the nation.</p>

                <p>The research project has three primary objectives: 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Investigate the automated data capture and AI needs to automate the COVID-19 Healthcare Supply Chain.</li>
                        <li>Build an optimization model using Gurobi optimizer in Python Language for the COVID-19 Supply Chain from manufacture to home delivery that addresses the needs of at-risk populations and communities.</li>
                        <li>Identify the readiness and the societal cost-benefit of this model for use when medicine and supplies become ready for the COVID-19 outbreak.</li>
                    </ol>
                    Our main focus is on the 2nd objective of the project i.e., to conduct an analysis of the available data and create an efficient supply chain model to predict the transportation and shortage cost for the vaccine distribution.
