                            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                            <p>This project seeks to broaden participation for Engineering Research Centers that are connected to nano-manufacturing and future quantum inspired research through Engineering 
                                Research Centers (ERC), Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) Bootcamps, professional experiences and 
                                recruitment.  We seek to use our top scientist connection framework (TSCF) to support underrepresented 
                                populations with networking, understanding and becoming motivated to continue in STEM fields and contribute and 
                                inspire the next generation of top STEM scientists, ultimately contributing the overall US STEM workforce.  We also seek 
                                to understand the performance of students exposed to the program on applying to and receiving fellowships such as the GRFP, acceptance into REU programs and graduate studies, and motivations toward seeking higher education in STEM fields along with the impacts of self-efficacy for underrepresented minorities.  We will measure the self-efficacy components with a mixed model educational design.  We will utilize a validated questionnaire to understand pre- and post-perceptions before and after different program components from students, faculty, and researchers.  We also will utilize a student journaling process to understand their experiences at a deeper level.  Students from Minority Serving Institutions, (MSI) such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) and Native American Institutions (NAI) will be invited to apply and participate with a consortium of ERCs, including CMaT, NASCENT, and CELL-MET, located at Georgia Tech, UT Austin, and Boston College, respectively.  Center directors for each of these ERCs have provided letters of collaboration and support, including information about the Center’s designated lead for culture of inclusion and diversity. It is anticipated that substantial STEM workforce development opportunities will result for underrepresented populations connected to these ERC and GRFP resources through the proposed project.</p>

                            <h3>Intellectual Merit</h3>
                            <p>This project capitalizes on work with top scientists conducting research at select Engineering Research Centers (ERCs). 
                                The NSF ERC program is the NSFs largest investment for top research and its infrastructure of diversity and inclusion directors 
                                supports this programs ability to gain access to these scientists. The PI will work with Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) in 
                                Texas and the northeastern United States and the Texas ERC (NASCENT) and Massachusetts ERC (CELL-MET) in years two and three. 
                                The co-PI is at a land grant institution in the state of Georgia and will work in partnership with the CMaT ERC at Georgia Tech
                                 and White House Initiative on HBCUs (WHIHBCUs) to gain further access to engineering and science students from HBCUs. A study on the impact of ERC scientific connectivity for URP applicants in Georgia, Texas, and the northeastern United States will be conducted. The program evaluator and advisory board will include former GRFP and ERC contacts. The study incorporates key factors from the NSFs 
                                recent publication on future ERCs and their impact on underrepresented minorities and women and National Academies Study on A New Vision for Center Based Engineering Research.</p>

                            <h3>Broadening Participation</h3>
                            <p>Success factors for many GRFP award winners include formal and informal training in scientific writing and communication, active participation in research experiences,
                                 professional development training, and access to world class scientists. Moreover, the successful submission of a competitive GRFP application improves educational and 
                                 workforce development outcomes for the majority of applicants and particularly for underrepresented populations. While STEM underrepresented populations at many leading 
                                 institutions are offered specialized fellowship and other preparation workshops, these services are often lacking at schools that do not have the resources or human capital 
                                 to offer such training. The proposed project connects currently funded NSF researchers creating cutting-edge solutions to top scientific challenges and located at three ERCs 
                                 with engineering and science underrepresented populations as a part of a unique GRFP bootcamp and professional experiences workshop. The project will include follow up webinars 
                                 to support the success factors for underrepresented populations and women in successfully applying for and winning prestigious fellowship (GRFP) and research (REU) opportunities, 
                                 applying to, entering, and completing graduate school at supporting ERC institutions. Results of this project will be presented at ASEE, ERC, and other related engineering conferences 
                                 and details published in a peer-reviewed engineering journals. A major goal of this project is to investigate and understand a framework for broadening participation at major hubs 
                                 of science and engineering in order to increase Americas research capacity 
                                and innovation. This project is expected to serve as a model for improving outcomes of engineering and other STEM underrepresented populations and Americas STEM workforce participation.</p>
